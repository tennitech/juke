## Project Description

This is project aims to create an open-source Spotify player, designed to run with low computing power.

Car Thing, a Spotify device designed for use in vehicles, is going to be discontinued at the end of 2024, rendering the hardware inoperational. 
The vast majority of product owners do not have an alternative solution. 
Our product is designed to be open-source in its entirety, able to be modified to run on a multitude of hardware, all while trusting in open-source.

Our sole focus is creating what we wish Spotify looked like. Modern products are dull, lacking a soul. JukeOS brings your Spotify to life.
