# *Juke - Your Music, Reimagined*

## ‚ùì *Who* are we?

We're a small team of 4 developers with a passion for making music lively again.

## ‚ùì *What* are we?

Let's cut to the chase. We're developing a retro, open-source music player that brings your music to life. How exactly?

## ‚ùì *Why* are we?

While the convenience of streaming is undeniable, we believe there's a way to combine both worlds‚Äîdelivering the ease of modern technology with the rich, hands-on experience of the past. With Juke, you get more than just music; you get the nostalgia, the ritual, and the authenticity, all without sacrificing the benefits of today's streaming platforms.
